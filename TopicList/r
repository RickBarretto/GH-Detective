    > r - [R is a free programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R has a wide variety of statistical linear and non-linear modeling and provides numerous graphical techniques.]

    > rails - [Ruby on Rails (Rails) is a web application framework written in Ruby. It is meant to help simplify the building of complex websites.]

    > raspberry-pi - [The Raspberry Pi is a popular single-board computer designed to promote the teaching of computer science in schools. The use of the Raspberry Pi computer ranges from robotics to home automation.]

    > ratchet - [Ratchet is a set of libraries that allows PHP developers to create real-time, bidirectional applications between clients and servers over WebSockets.]

    > react - [React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library that makes developing interactive user interfaces simple.]

    > react-native - [React Native is a JavaScript mobile framework developed by Facebook. It allows developers to build Android and iOS mobile apps using JavaScript and reuse code across web and mobile applications.]

    > reactiveui - [ReactiveUI is a composable, cross-platform model-view-viewmodel framework for all .NET platforms, inspired by functional reactive programming.]

    > redux - [Redux is an open source JavaScript library, designed to allow for state management of JavaScript applications. Inspired by Elm, Redux is a debugging tool and supports robust application data-flow architecture. Redux is frequently used in combination with React.]

    > rest-api - [A representational state transfer (REST) API is a way to provide compatibility between computer systems on the Internet. The concept was first outlined in a dissertation by Roy Fielding in 2000.]

    > ruby - [Ruby was developed by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in 1995 with the intent of having an easily readable programming language. It is used by the Rails framework to create dynamic web-applications. Ruby's syntax is similar to that of Perl and Python.]

    > rust - [Rust is a systems programming language created by Mozilla. It is similar to C++, but is designed for improved memory safety without sacrificing performance.]

    > sass - [Sass is a stylesheet language with a main implementation in Ruby. It is an extension of CSS that makes improvements to the old stylesheet format, such as being able to declare variables and using a cleaner nesting syntax.]

    > scala - [Scala is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java.]

    > sdn - [Software-defined networking (SDN) separates network control from network data forwarding, allowing networks to be programmed and centrally managed with standard protocols. SDN is an enabler of network virtualization, or the ability to run multiple virtual network topologies on a shared physical network.]

    > security - [Cybersecurity (security) includes controlling physical access to hardware as well as protection from attacks that come via network access, data injection, and code injection.]

    > server - [A server is a program or device that provides functionality for other programs and devices, called clients. This relation forms the Client-Server Model.]

    > serverless - [Serverless architecture refers to apps that depend on third-party services (backend as a service, or BaaS) or custom code (functions as a service, or FaaS). Their goal is to free the developer and operator from managing the server their code runs on.]

    > shell - [A shell is a text-based terminal, used for manipulating programs and files. Shell scripts typically manage program execution.]

    > sketch - [Sketch is a digital design toolkit built for designers, intended for editing vector graphics in macOS. It is used primarily for user interface and icon design.]

    > spacevim - [SpaceVim is a distribution of the vim editor that's inspired by spacemacs. It manages collections of plugins in layers, which help collect related packages together to provide features. For example, the python layer collects deoplete.nvim, neomake, and jedi-vim together to provide autocompletion, syntax checking, and documentation lookup. This approach helps keep configuration organized and reduces overhead for the user by keeping them from having to think about what packages to install.]

    > spring-boot - [Spring Boot is a coding and configuration model for Java applications. Spring was developed by Pivotal Software.]

    > sql - [SQL stands for structured query language. It uses commands such as "select", "insert", "update", "delete". Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.]

    > storybook - [With Storybook you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them outside of your application.]

    > support - [A help desk is a resource intended to provide the customer or end user with information and support related to a company's or institution's products and services.]

    > swift - [Swift is a general-purpose programming language built using a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design patterns. Inspired by many other modern programming languages, Swift is intended to be more resilient and expressive than Objective-C, its predecessor.]

    > symfony - [Symfony is a set of reusable PHP components and a PHP framework for web projects.]
