    > javascript - [JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.]

    > json - [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standard file format that uses text to communicate data objects to array data types. This notation makes it easy for applications to parse and generate files. JSON grew out of the need to have a real-time server-to-web browser communication.]

    > julia - [Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language designed to address the needs of high-performance numerical analysis and computational science. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library.]

    > jupyter-notebook - [The Jupyter Notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application for Project Jupyter. Jupyter notebooks are documents that allow for creating and sharing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text together.]
